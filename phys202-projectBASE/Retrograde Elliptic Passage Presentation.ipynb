    "This notebook contains a mathematical description of the collision of two galaxies, one with several orbiting stars, as described by classical mechanics. The motion will be plotted at several values of time starting from some set of initial conditions. The situations modelled will be as follows: one case of retrograde passage and one case of direct passage. To model these a set of differential equations is defined and solved using Python's \"odeint\" solver. The solutions are the position and velocities of the distrupting galaxy and stars, which are saved into an array. To verify the correctness of the solution, the energy is plotted as a function of time to ensure that energy is conserved. "

    "The base question that this notebook explores is the mechanics of direct or retrograde passage of two massive point particles (galaxies). The difference between these two situations is the relative spin of the stars on the initial galaxy and the velocity of the disrupting galaxy. Retrograde passage is the case where the stars spin in a direction opposite to the motion of the disrupting galaxy, whilst direct passage has these velocities in the same orientation. In both cases the disrupting galaxy acts on the stars as well as the initial galaxy, disrupting their motions. The task is to plot the motion of all these bodies, and as a check, their energies. If energy is conserved, and the two galaxies are shown to interact, then it is concluded that the code accurately describes the interaction between two massie galaxies."
